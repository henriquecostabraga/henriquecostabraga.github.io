# FUGA — Evacuation & Pathfinding Simulation Framework

## Overview

FUGA is an agent-based evacuation modeling framework originally conceived and developed during my Master's (2010–2012) and Doctoral research (2012–2018).

The framework was fully designed, implemented, and analytically structured by me, integrating pathfinding algorithms, distance-map generation, multi-agent movement dynamics, and computational diagnostics for built-environment evacuation analysis.

FUGA constitutes a foundational research line focused on algorithmic modeling of pedestrian dynamics and evacuation processes under structural constraints.

## Core Methodological Elements

- Distance-map generation using Von Neumann and Moore neighborhood structures  
- Shortest-path computation and search algorithm comparison  
- Multi-agent movement logic in discretized spatial grids  
- Exit distribution impact analysis  
- Built-environment evacuation diagnostics  
- Integration with fire safety regulatory frameworks  

---

## Research Output

The FUGA framework generated multiple peer-reviewed publications in both international and Brazilian journals, addressing:

- Search algorithm comparison in built environments  
- Exit configuration impact on evacuation performance  
- Regulatory implications of evacuation modeling  
- Algorithmic treatment of pedestrian displacement

## Research Character

FUGA represents an author-driven research line focused on the analytical modeling of evacuation systems, with full responsibility over conceptual development, computational implementation, and scientific production.
