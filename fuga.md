# FUGA — Evacuation Modeling Research Line (2010–2018)

## Overview

FUGA is an author-driven evacuation modeling framework originally conceived and independently developed during my Master's (2010–2012) and Doctoral research (2012–2018).

The framework was fully designed, implemented, and analytically structured by me, integrating deterministic routing algorithms, multi-agent behavioral modeling, and computational diagnostics for built-environment evacuation analysis.

FUGA constitutes a consolidated methodological research line focused on algorithmic modeling of pedestrian dynamics under structural and regulatory constraints.

## Architectural Structure

FUGA was structured into two complementary modules:

### **FUGA Path** — Deterministic Routing Layer

A pre-simulation routing module based on a visibility-driven exploration algorithm operating over discretized spatial environments with fixed obstacles.

- Generates geometrically optimal evacuation routes  
- Residual deviation from continuous solutions limited to discretization error  
- Independent of behavioral modeling  
- Provides structural optimal field prior to simulation  

The visibility-based exploration algorithm emerged as the central structural contribution of the framework.

### **FUGA Move** — Behavioral & Dynamic Simulation Layer

A multi-agent simulation module responsible for modeling human interaction and dynamic constraints.

- Multi-agent movement logic in discretized spatial grids  
- Fuzzy-logic-based decision mechanisms (original focus of the research)  
- Behavioral modulation of optimal routing paths  
- Exit configuration and crowd interaction effects  

This layer balances the geometrically optimal paths generated by FUGA Path with realistic human and crowd dynamics.

## Methodological Scope

- Distance-map generation and algorithmic comparison (Von Neumann vs. Moore neighborhoods)  
- Visibility-driven exploration for optimal routing  
- Behavioral modeling through fuzzy logic  
- Exit distribution impact analysis  
- Built-environment evacuation diagnostics  
- Integration with fire safety regulatory frameworks

## Research Character

FUGA represents an independently developed methodological research line, with full responsibility over conceptual development, computational implementation, and scientific production.

The framework generated multiple peer-reviewed publications and extensive international conference dissemination.

The research line is considered methodologically consolidated and serves as the foundational basis for future independent developments in evacuation modeling architectures.

## Development Status

FUGA is considered methodologically consolidated as a completed research line (2010–2018).

Future developments in evacuation modeling will proceed through new and independently structured computational architectures building upon the conceptual foundations established in FUGA.
