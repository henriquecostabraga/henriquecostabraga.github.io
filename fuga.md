# FUGA — Evacuation & Pathfinding Simulation Framework

## Overview

FUGA is an agent-based simulation framework for evacuation modeling and pedestrian dynamics in built environments.

The system integrates distance-map generation algorithms, multi-agent movement logic, and exit distribution analysis to support fire safety diagnostics and evacuation research.

---

## Research Context

FUGA originates from research in evacuation modeling, pathfinding algorithms, and fire safety system evaluation.

The framework has supported peer-reviewed publications and ongoing international submissions in evacuation dynamics and computational modeling.
