# ODDET — Origin–Destination Data Evaluation Tool

## Overview

ODDET is a structured computational framework designed for large-scale Origin–Destination (OD) matrix processing and metropolitan mobility diagnostics.

It integrates geodetic computation, graph-based analytics, statistical filtering, and modular data-processing pipelines into a scalable analytical system.

The framework is currently being consolidated as ODDET v1.0, with institutional deployment planned on a dedicated server for authorized research access.

## Research Context

ODDET supports ongoing international research efforts in large-scale mobility modeling, interzonal traversal analysis, and analytical diagnostics of metropolitan systems.

Multiple conference papers derived from the ODDET framework are currently under peer review.
