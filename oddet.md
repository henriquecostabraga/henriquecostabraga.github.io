# ODDET — Origin–Destination Data Evaluation Tool

## Overview

ODDET is a structured computational framework designed for large-scale Origin–Destination (OD) matrix processing and metropolitan mobility diagnostics.

The framework integrates geodetic computation (Haversine-based distance estimation), graph-based analytics, percentile-based statistical filtering, and modular data-processing pipelines into a scalable analytical architecture for metropolitan systems.

ODDET is currently being consolidated as version 1.0, with institutional deployment planned on a dedicated server to enable controlled remote access for authorized researchers.

## Research Context

ODDET supports ongoing international research efforts in large-scale mobility modeling, interzonal traversal diagnostics, and structural analysis of metropolitan OD systems derived from mobile phone data (CDRs).

The framework is designed not merely as a visualization tool, but as an analytical infrastructure for methodological investigation of spatial interaction patterns, traversal intensity, and structural biases in OD matrices.

Multiple conference papers derived from the ODDET architecture are currently under peer review.

## Future Goals — ODDET v2.0 (Dec 2026)

The next major milestone (ODDET v2.0) aims to incorporate modal inference capabilities based on mobile phone-derived OD matrices.

Planned developments include:

- Integration of statistical and probabilistic models for transport mode inference (e.g., private vehicle, public transport, active modes) from spatiotemporal OD patterns.
- Incorporation of auxiliary datasets (network topology, travel time distributions, zoning characteristics, and possibly ticketing or survey data) for calibration and validation.
- Development of a meso-scale modal classification layer capable of associating inferred transport modes with OD flows.
- Sensitivity analysis of modal inference under varying spatial aggregation levels and privacy constraints.
- Extension toward macro–meso–micro analytical integration, allowing downstream simulation modules to incorporate inferred modal structures.

The objective of v2.0 is to transition ODDET from structural OD diagnostics to enriched mobility-system characterization, advancing toward integrated metropolitan transport modeling.
