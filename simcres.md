# SimCres — 3D Hybrid Cellular Automata for Microstructural Evolution

## Overview

SimCres is an independently conceived and fully implemented computational framework for modeling microstructural evolution in metallic materials using three-dimensional Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA).

The platform was developed with full responsibility for conceptual formulation, mathematical structuring, algorithmic implementation, and scientific production.

A central contribution of SimCres is the formulation and implementation of a hybrid CA approach enabling high-fidelity spherical grain modeling under discretized lattice constraints. This formulation overcomes geometric limitations inherent to traditional cellular automata and establishes a consistent basis for quantitative microstructural and interfacial analysis.

## Methodological Foundations

SimCres is structured around the following core principles:

- Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) formulation for geometrically consistent spherical grain modeling  
- Comparative modeling with traditional CA (including cuboctahedral growth configurations)  
- Extension to spheroidal morphologies  
- Equivalent and voxel-based surface-area estimation methodologies  
- Fully discrete computation of interfacial area evolution between phases, without phenomenological support equations or empirical correction factors  
- Large-scale lattice-based 3D simulations (200³–201³ grids)  
- Statistical characterization of polycrystalline microstructures  

The fully discrete treatment of interfacial area evolution constitutes a key structural element of the framework, made possible by geometrically controlled spherical modeling and robust surface-area estimation techniques.
