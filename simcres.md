# SimCres — 3D Hybrid Cellular Automata for Microstructural Evolution

## Overview

SimCres is an independently conceived and fully implemented computational framework for modeling recrystallization and grain-growth phenomena using three-dimensional hybrid cellular automata (HCA).

The platform was developed as an author-driven research initiative during a concentrated Master’s research cycle (2024), with full responsibility for conceptual design, mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and scientific production.

SimCres integrates lattice-based simulation, morphological analysis, and surface-area estimation methodologies into a structured computational modeling architecture.

## Research Output

The SimCres framework has generated:

- 2 peer-reviewed journal publications  
- 4 additional journal manuscripts currently under evaluation  

All outputs were structured with direct focus on journal-level dissemination in computational materials engineering.

## Research Character

SimCres represents an independently developed computational research line in materials science, designed and implemented without external funding or institutional infrastructure.

The framework reflects a high-intensity research cycle centered on methodological rigor, computational architecture, and journal-level scientific production.

## Future Directions

SimCres remains an active methodological research line. 

Future developments may include expansion of surface modeling methodologies, enhanced morphological descriptors, larger-scale simulations, and potential architectural restructuring under a next-generation framework identity.

The platform will continue to evolve opportunistically, driven by research feasibility and emerging scientific questions in computational materials modeling.
