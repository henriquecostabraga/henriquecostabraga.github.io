# SimCres — 3D Hybrid Cellular Automata for Microstructural Evolution

## Overview

SimCres is a computational framework based on three-dimensional hybrid cellular automata for modeling recrystallization and grain growth in metallic materials.

The system integrates lattice-based modeling, morphological analysis, and surface-area estimation methodologies.

---

## Research Context

SimCres builds upon published research in hybrid cellular automata and computational materials engineering.

Recent work focuses on spheroidal grain parameterization and analytical surface estimation methods.
