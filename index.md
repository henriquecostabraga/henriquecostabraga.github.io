# Henrique Costa Braga, Ph.D.
Engineer | Applied Systems Architecture | Research-to-Implementation Design  

Architecting computational systems that bridge research and real-world engineering applications.

## Professional Overview

I am an engineer and Ph.D. specialized in mathematical and computational modeling of complex engineering systems. My work focuses on designing structured computational architectures that transform theoretical models into operational analytical frameworks.

My professional trajectory integrates academic research and applied engineering practice. I have coordinated research activities involving large-scale data-processing pipelines, mobility system analytics, and simulation-based engineering models, while also holding formal technical responsibility (ART – CREA) in fire safety and regulatory compliance projects.

I operate at the interface between theory, modeling, and implementation — building systems that are analytically rigorous, computationally structured, and practically deployable.

I am open to academic appointments, postdoctoral opportunities, applied R&D collaborations, and senior technical engineering roles involving modeling, simulation, and analytical system design.

## Core Projects & Computational Frameworks

### ODDET — Origin–Destination Data Evaluation Tool  
**Large-scale mobility analytics framework**

A structured Python-based framework for processing and diagnosing large-scale Origin–Destination (OD) matrices derived from anonymized mobile phone datasets, operating over real metropolitan road-network topology.

Within the APQ-04889-24 research initiative, under the general coordination of **Prof. Dr. Guilherme de Castro Leiva**, I lead the development of the graph-based computational architecture and multi-source shortest-path analytical framework (Dijkstra-based) underpinning ODDET. I am responsible for the methodological structuring of traversal diagnostics, the implementation of scalable computational pipelines, and the scientific production associated with its analytical development and applications.

**Core capabilities:**

- Multi-source shortest-path allocation over real road networks  
- Interzonal traversal diagnostics  
- Edge-level flow distribution analysis  
- Percentile-based OD filtering strategies  
- Corridor identification and threshold analytics  
- Modular and scalable data-processing architecture  

Application context: Metropolitan-scale mobility diagnostics and analytical evaluation of CDR-derived OD matrices (RMBH, Brazil).

### FUGA — Evacuation Modeling Research Line  
Foundational evacuation and pathfinding architecture (2010–2018)

An author-driven evacuation modeling framework originally conceived and independently developed during my Master’s and Doctoral research (2010–2018).

FUGA was structured into two complementary modules:

- **FUGA Path** — A visibility-driven deterministic routing module generating geometrically optimal evacuation paths over discretized environments with fixed obstacles.
- **FUGA Move** — A dynamic multi-agent simulation module incorporating behavioral modeling (including fuzzy-logic-based decision mechanisms) to balance optimal routing with human and crowd dynamics.

The visibility-based exploration algorithm emerged as the central structural contribution of the framework, producing geometrically optimal routes under discretization constraints.

FUGA generated multiple peer-reviewed journal publications and extensive international conference dissemination.

The research line is considered methodologically consolidated and forms the foundation for future independent developments in evacuation modeling architectures.

### SimCres — 3D Hybrid Cellular Automata  
**Independent computational framework for microstructural evolution modeling**

An independently developed computational platform for modeling recrystallization and grain-growth phenomena using three-dimensional Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA).

SimCres introduced and implemented a hybrid CA formulation enabling high-fidelity spherical grain modeling under discretized lattice constraints, overcoming geometric limitations inherent to traditional cellular automata.

**Core capabilities:**
- Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) formulation for spherical grain modeling  
- Comparative modeling with traditional CA (including cuboctahedral configurations)  
- Extension to spheroidal morphologies  
- Equivalent and voxel-based surface-area estimation  
- Fully discrete computation of interfacial area evolution between phases, without phenomenological support equations or empirical correction factors, made possible by geometrically consistent spherical modeling and robust surface-area estimation
- Large-scale lattice-based 3D simulation  
- Statistical characterization of polycrystalline microstructures
