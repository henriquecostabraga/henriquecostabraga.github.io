## Professional Overview

I am an engineer and Ph.D. specialized in mathematical and computational modeling of complex engineering systems. My work focuses on designing structured computational architectures that transform theoretical models into operational analytical frameworks.

My professional trajectory integrates academic research and applied engineering practice. I have coordinated research activities involving large-scale data-processing pipelines, mobility system analytics, and simulation-based engineering models, while also holding formal technical responsibility (ART – CREA) in fire safety and regulatory compliance projects.

I operate at the interface between theory, modeling, and implementation — building systems that are analytically rigorous, computationally structured, and practically deployable.

I am open to academic appointments, postdoctoral opportunities, applied R&D collaborations, and senior technical engineering roles involving modeling, simulation, and analytical system design.
