## Profile

I am an engineer and Ph.D. specialized in mathematical and computational modeling of complex engineering systems, with emphasis on the design and implementation of structured computational architectures.

My work integrates theoretical formulation, numerical modeling, and software architecture design to build operational computational frameworks capable of addressing real-world engineering problems.

I develop model-driven systems combining hybrid cellular automata, agent-based modeling, graph-based algorithms, numerical simulation, and structured data-processing pipelines. My work emphasizes modular design, architectural clarity, and reproducible analytical workflows.

My professional trajectory bridges academic research and applied engineering practice, including formal technical responsibility (ART – CREA) in fire safety systems and regulatory compliance projects.

I coordinate research activities involving large-scale data processing pipelines and computational modeling architectures, translating analytical concepts into deployable computational tools.

I am open to academic positions, postdoctoral opportunities, applied R&D collaborations, and technical engineering roles involving modeling, simulation, and analytical system design.
