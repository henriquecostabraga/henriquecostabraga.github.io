## About

I am an engineer and researcher specialized in mathematical and computational modeling applied to complex engineering systems.

My work integrates hybrid cellular automata, agent-based modeling, numerical simulation, pathfinding algorithms, computational flid dynamics (FDS/NIST), and data-driven analytical methods to develop practical computational tools for real-world engineering problems.

Applications include microstructural evolution in materials, urban mobility and origin–destination modeling, pedestrian dynamics, evacuation analysis, and fire safety systems.

I have extensive experience translating theoretical and mathematical formulations into operational software frameworks, primarily in Python, combining numerical modeling, simulation, and analytical system design.

Recent projects involve large-scale mobility modeling based on mobile phone data (OD matrices), where I coordinate research activities related to data processing pipelines, modeling architecture, and analytical frameworks.

I am open to academic positions, postdoctoral opportunities, applied R&D collaborations, and technical engineering roles involving modeling, simulation, and analytical systems.
