## About

I am a researcher with interdisciplinary expertise in computational modeling applied to materials science, fire safety, and transportation systems. My work focuses on hybrid cellular automata, agent-based models, and data-driven methods for simulating and optimizing complex physical and socio-technical systems.

I have strong experience in translating theoretical models into practical computational tools and am open to international research collaborations, applied research projects, and technical roles in simulation.
