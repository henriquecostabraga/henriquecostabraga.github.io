## About

I am a researcher with interdisciplinary expertise in computational modeling applied to materials science, transportation systems, and fire safety. My work focuses on the development and application of hybrid cellular automata, agent-based models, pathfinding algorithms, and data-driven methods to analyze, simulate, and optimize complex physical and socio-technical systems.

I have extensive experience translating theoretical and mathematical models into practical computational tools, with applications ranging from microstructural evolution in materials to pedestrian dynamics, safety analysis, and mobility systems. My work combines numerical modeling, simulation, and scientific software development, primarily in Python.

More recently, my research activities have focused primarily on the modeling and analysis of origin–destination (OD) matrices derived from mobile phone data, with applications in urban mobility and transport planning. In this context, I currently guide a small research team working on data processing, modeling, and analytical methods for large-scale mobility datasets. In parallel, I continue to develop research studies in computational materials science and fire safety.

I am currently open to international research collaborations, postdoctoral opportunities, applied research projects, and technical engineering roles, including but not limited to modeling and simulation.
